Trust was a really big issue over of course of eleven years i've probably moved around in between homes and different families 15 times we're just having this normal check-in and at the very end of it they were like what would you think about and what would you want if we were able to tell you that you would be able to find a home i really had negative thoughts on it i'm not gonna ever find a forever home i'm just gonna end up back in the foster home getting that news really put me into like oh my gosh oh my gosh this is finally happening it's something that i've always wanted but i mean at times it was like this is not gonna happen there's no point even looking and trying any further he wasn't sure if he wanted to be adopted because he didn't know who the family would be that would adopt him and that we really resonated with me because i just thought like that makes so much sense you know but then once we all met each other and got to know each other i mean we quickly as a family started talking about adoption and that's our futures headed my name is jenny and i'm alex's mom absurd that alex's father alx express he wanted to be with the family that was gonna love him for who he was and would have adventures and do things and that's kind of what we're all about when we saw alex and his video and read about him it was just like wow it kids made for us first time i ever met them i was at my old foster home through boys and girls aid and we had planned for this and i was super excited i was like this is gonna be awesome it's just the strangest thing to like knock on the door and know that you're gonna you know meet your kid when i actually moved in it was awesome remember we were coming down the driveway and we were talking about all the animals and the house and all these different things alex jumps in with both feet to most circumstances and he did that with the animals means they're pretty much familiar with everything here from cooking to starting trucks and driving trucks that you just learned a lot they have these two people in my life that i can trust is just a really big thing because i can actually know that it's going to go somewhere we hope for alex everything that you know any any parent would hope for their kids hopefully that our love and the stability and always having a place to come home to will give him that foundation to do all the great things that he you know that his aren't heart desires so i've always wanted to go to college and get a good job being here i have a ten times better chance at doing any of those know that there's a ton of kids out there who are maybe they're just looking for someone to love them from where our family is it's just it's just been the best thing it feels good it feels good to have a place that you know if somebody's gonna care for you and want you i think we bring it from endless amount to alex and they think he brings even more to us i mean we've got a big beautiful life and to to be able to bring alex into our home and into our hearts and into our lives that's been amazing it's a blessing you
