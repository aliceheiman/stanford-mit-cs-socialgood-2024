0:25
BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM MY
0:27
FAMILY AT THE AGE OF 7 ANTHONY
0:28
PRESTON AND HIS SIBLINGS WERE
0:29
REMOVED FROM THEIR HOME BY THE
0:32
DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES
0:33
AT THAT YOUNG AGE HE DIDN'T
0:34
UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS CONFUSED
0:37
ANGRY WAS LIKE WHY NOT WITH MY
0:38
FAMILY.
0:40
I WENT OUT WITH MY PARENTS
0:42
AT ACTUALLY IS A STORY A LATER
0:43
LEARNED DRUGS AND ALCOHOL
0:44
ISN'T WHERE THE REASON HE WAS
0:45
PLACED IN THE FOSTER CARE
0:47
SYSTEM.
0:48
THAT'S WHERE HE SPENT THE
0:49
NEXT 14 YEARS UNTIL HE AGED
0:53
OUT AT 21.
0:53
HE SPENT THOSE FOR SEVERAL
0:55
YEARS GOING FROM HOUSE TO
0:57
HOUSE TO HOUSE CAN'T EVEN
0:58
COUNT HOW MANY DIFFERENT HOMES
0:59
I WASN'T TAKING AWAY FROM ALL
1:02
HE KNEW AS A CHILD HE FELT
1:03
LIKE HE WAS LIVING AMONG
1:05
STRANGERS TRY TO DO THEIR BEST
1:05
TO MAKE YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE,
1:06
BUT.
1:09
IT'S REALLY HARD WHEN HERE.
1:10
WHEN YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG
1:12
YOU'RE GOING TO STAY THERE THE
1:13
INSTABILITY, CHRONIC STRESS
1:13
AND TRAUMA TOOK ITS TOLL ON
1:17
HIM IN THE I GOT A LOT OF
1:17
TROUBLE.
1:22
I ACTED OUT A LOT IN I WAS
1:23
ANGRY AND I WAS CONFUSED AND
1:24
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON
1:26
AND WHY I WAS DIFFERENT THAN
1:28
ALL THE OTHER KIDS MOST OF THE
1:30
TIME THAT BAD BEHAVIOR HAD ITS
1:30
CONSEQUENCES.
1:32
BUT FROM 7TH GRADE TO
1:33
SENIOR YEAR. ANTHONY GOT TO
1:36
STAY IN THE SAME FOSTER HOME.
1:37
THAT'S WHERE HE MET HIS
1:38
CLOTHES, HIS FOSTER BROTHER
1:39
SHILOH HAMPTON HAVEN'T SHILOH
1:41
WITH ME WAS. HE GAVE ME A
1:42
SENSE OF FAMILY. THEY GAVE ME
1:46
A SENSE OF. BEING ABLE TO BE A
1:47
BIG BROTHER WHICH I THOUGHT
1:49
WAS STRIPPED FROM ME WHEN I
1:50
WAS TAKEN OUT OF HOME AND
1:52
PLACED IN THE FOSTER SYSTEM
1:53
STARVED FOR ACCEPTANCE ANTHONY
1:54
AND SHILOH FELL INTO THE WRONG
1:55
CROWD. HE ENDED UP GOING TO
1:56
BOY CENTER.
1:56
AND HANGING OUT A HOLIDAY
1:59
PARK RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET.
2:00
WHICH IF YOU KNOW MOST PEOPLE
2:02
KNOW IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE
2:04
SAFEST PLACE. BUDDIES HANG OUT
2:04
THE GROUP OF FRIENDS THAT
2:05
WEREN'T ALWAYS THE BEST
2:08
INFLUENCE ON HIM AND HE AND
2:09
I'VE BEEN CAUGHT UP IN GANG
2:10
INVOLVED SHOOTING SHILOH.
2:13

2:14
AFTER THAT I REALIZED I GOT
2:18
TO TURN IT AROUND BECAUSE HE
2:19
CAN'T TURN IT AROUND FOR
2:20
HIMSELF PSYCHED ABOUT TO DO IT
2:22
FOR HIM IN HIGH SCHOOL.

AND HE DECIDED TO FIND A
2:24
HEALTHIER WAY TO COPE WITH
