me and pastor jan and we we were just in the beginning of kovid and so everything was shut down we had decided that we were going to have most of our services outside and so we're going out in nature and and filming all of our services and so mine was filmed at a river in the mountain and so i was sitting next to this like rocks it was very pretty and i had shots on so i had this short sun i just got my color for the my very first color and i had my my shirt my black shirt on and a collar and it was so uncomfortable i was like oh my god why am i wearing this thing i mean in my brain i'm just like i shouldn't fall in this water because i cannot swim for the life of me and i probably will drown it wasn't even that much water but i was thinking this and i stopped preaching and i'm like i don't know if i'm going to be able to do this it's a bitter like of a sentence and he says no you know just breathe and just do your thing i'm like do you mind if i just like free flow this sermon i basically preached without really following my script but at that moment i felt like it needed to come from my heart that that sermon and it was a lot about fears and how few sometimes paralyze us and stop us from just crossing something as simple as a river to just go over to the other side Story 2000 is when we first became official refugees i lived for my country democratic republic of congo and it was a lot of political issues my uncle who my late uncle who was very involved in a lot of human rights stuff um kind of just got in trouble with these politicians so our entire family had to like move to uganda all me and my brothers and him and his entire family as a kid it was just like we're going to the trip it didn't feel anything other than we're going on a trip it's going to be a fun trip and you know that lasted 15 years and then you don't know the language and you want to play with kids you know and you want to go out and play with kids and none of the kids know what you're talking about or just like none of the kids want to play with you and it was those were the most difficult moments of that part of growing up there's four of us children my mom so there's a five of us living in a one living room bedroom it was good again i think a lot of like childhood things for me were good because i had everybody i had my cousins in the same space i had my mom in the same space i had my uncle right over there my uncle was very we loved our uncle one of my favorite memories with my uncle he would like in the evening he would he would sit us outside there's a candle and he has me on his lap and my other cards in maurizia and then all the boys were like sitting down and though he starts making us like show me your talent what talent do you have and so like my brother he was like he he could move his one like chest and just just and so like everybody was showing like their different talents and and i didn't have any so i'm like i don't think i have any talent and he says sure you do there's a movie that mr beat had he could move his ears right and so i'd figured out that i could do that i tried to i moved my ear my my one ear shaking and my other ears shaking and it's he's just like he's like that is the most amazing thing i've seen and i felt like so validated i was super happy um he was such he was such a great uncle i i loved i loved having him it was it was a sad day when we um when we lost him i remember i was home and her aunt comes like running over and she's like crying maurici is crying my aunt is crying and i'm not i'm just like what is happening what is going on and i have i i was eight i think i don't know why i didn't connect that he was dying maybe a year later is when it hit me that he was he was gone for good and that he wasn't ever gonna come back um yeah i feel like i have a lot of rich memories with him life is very precious and to live i think to live in a life that you don't recognize that is missing out on on a lot of things i think the biggest insecurity in any for any refugees to be in a country that you know you always know you're an outsider at some point someone is gonna say you don't belong you need to leave during those years like we would interview for like different countries and sometimes those countries would reject your case and they would say they don't have it they don't have space so they just don't feel like your skate your case is priority like sometimes i would wake up at like four in the morning to go to the offices and just like wait wait to hear back wait to just receive say we had like given up we're like okay this is never gonna happen and so we're kind of starting to like figure out different ways to just live life in uganda and my mom gets this call from from one of her friends your name was posted on the people who usa is going to interview we're like what Interview uh interviews happen and then everything starts happening and i'm like oh my god it's actually happening our mom and our little brother come and me and terry and yanique stay behind uh they came in october october 5th uh in 2016 and they were here for three months um they moved out after vela's oldest child terry finally arrived from uganda so it took three months for him to get here they were supposed to when we got the call from lutheran community services they were supposed to be here for about a week and then all the other children were gonna supposedly come within a week of when they arrived but the problem is trump became president during that time and trump plans on closing the borders me and yanik are still in uganda we know that if the voters are closed then we're going to be stuck there for a much much longer time so it was about two weeks and we got a call from lutheran community services and they said no no we're still trying to figure out why the delay but could they stay longer you know we could find another place and by then i'd we'd fallen in love with them so i said no they should stay here it was like having family here so mom out here was working was already in connection with kathleen and kathleen and joe helped connect them i went down to representative derrick gilmer and wow within days they were here we were among like the last few people to cross and come he was the most relieved like my i remember my heart just like feeling so light once we came bella was almost like having my sister we just chatted all of it all the time it was she was just a delight yeah i think they're like best friends especially when they're both looking in crisis or like going through something or like odin i found this recipe that i think is really good it's just like sharing that when people arrive in this country the lutheran community services tries to find apartments but they're not always the apartment's always ready at the time they get here because it's going to last a minute so they said yeah we could have somebody temporarily see these are the kind of stories that makes sour work so meaningful our partner lirs incredible it's very strong many people that i have worked over the years who have been so wonderful so committed and dedicated to this work they felt like my sons my sister it's time to get started in a new life we learn from them they learn from us i guess we just had a great time she'd tell me she was thinking about getting a masters of counseling at the university because as an employee she could go to the counseling program for free so i was encouraging her to do that but meanwhile pastor jan seemed to know something i didn't know that he would be having conversations about her called the ministry filled with gratitude for just the opportunity to be with her on this journey because of what i experienced personally from her her natural communication gifts and her ability to be open and so interested in people and welcoming of people she is really really gifted in what i would call the whole field of like pastoral care and counseling she has a real wisdom for her age and an ability to both listen to people and reflect back to people in lots of ways i'm experiencing that in our conversations and i i see that within her too i was going on pastor care visits and so i went over to hermann's place and he was just the most warm person that i've ever met he was just like super welcoming from the very beginning and there's something about your presence your manner or something that just kind of ushered me into the wider world like it was uh more a part of the big the the universal body of christ you know it was kind of empowering for me just imagine how it feels to see emily standing now in our church with a collar and a cassock on that's pretty neat that's pretty neat i thank god for that she was preaching on jacob in the old testament so jacob had been on the run and crossing this river and they were filming it by a river i remember and emily was preaching that when she was done with the sermon joe and i looked at each other and just said wow i mean she was all ready she hadn't even had any classes at school yet even with those fears and with all of our past kind of like jacob's weirdness and all of the craziness of our lives and the things that we think define who we are stop us from seeing who god calls us you know that god calls us beloved that we're loved and held and just you know embraced by god even even though we were like messed up in so many ways and just taking that one step just crossing over that river and getting over that fear saying i'm gonna go into this and see what god is calling me into when people say seattle is the city of rain they're really not joking like there are days it rains from morning to evening and you wake up the next day and it's still raining like it's just non-stop constant rain in the first two years that was really really hard i love washington it's calm i'm not a person that loves the city a lot feels comfortable for me to be myself to go out i mean obviously anybody that comes as a refugee has left everything behind to witness somebody or to just know somebody who has experienced that kind of pain and suffering yet is so loving but willing to speak speak that and share that i just think that's important i've always wanted to have home i haven't fully found a place that i personally call home outside of my mom i feel like i'm slowly getting there i have a lot of you know like kathleen and joe have become part of our family you know hope i can create a home here like that you
