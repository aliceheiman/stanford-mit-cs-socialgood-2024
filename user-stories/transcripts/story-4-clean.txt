I can struggles with foster care are nothing new the state is managing a system responsible for more than 8,000 children very challenging are always hot shows how the power of a dedicated foster parent, and a portland foster care charity turn life around from an for mcminnville. it goes all way back to. being taken away from my family at the age of 7 anthony preston and his siblings were removed from their home by the department of human services at that young age he didn't understand why i was confused angry was like why not with my family. i went out with my parents at actually is a story a later learned drugs and alcohol isn't where the reason he was placed in the foster care system. that's where he spent the next 14 years until he aged out at 21. he spent those for several years going from house to house to house can't even count how many different homes i wasn't taking away from all he knew as a child he felt like he was living among strangers try to do their best to make you feel comfortable, but. it's really hard when here. when you have no idea how long you're going to stay there the instability, chronic stress and trauma took its toll on him in the i got a lot of trouble. i acted out a lot in i was angry and i was confused and didn't know what was going on and why i was different than all the other kids most of the time that bad behavior had its consequences. but from 7th grade to senior year. anthony got to stay in the same foster home. that's where he met his clothes, his foster brother shiloh hampton haven't shiloh with me was. he gave me a sense of family. they gave me a sense of. being able to be a big brother which i thought was stripped from me when i was taken out of home and placed in the foster system starved for acceptance anthony and shiloh fell into the wrong crowd. he ended up going to boy center. and hanging out a holiday park right across the street. which if you know most people know it's not necessarily the safest place. buddies hang out the group of friends that weren't always the best influence on him and he and i've been caught up in gang involved shooting shiloh. was the only one hit. after that i realized i got to turn it around because he can't turn it around for himself psyched about to do it for him in high school. and he decided to find a healthier way to cope with trauma. he started sports got involved with. you know different communities that actually gave me that since a family that i didn't actually get necessarily at home. the woman who kept him in line all those years was one strict mama. anthony's beloved late foster mom missus washington. her structure and unconditional love helped propel him in the right direction. she showed really consistent love raised me to be the man that i am today and i would not be anywhere close to map with our his newfound drive and perseverance brought him into an elite group. anthony became the 35% of foster youth to graduate from high school let them know that there's a way out of that life that doesn't involve anything illegal and went on to become the 2% of foster youth to graduate from college. he received his degree in criminal justice from western oregon university, he's now putting that degree to use oil or i'm a police officer for the speaking on stage at a foster care fundraiser, anthony picks up his story with how a portland foster care organization helped change his life to the reason i'm telling my story isn't to make you feel bad for me. it isn't so that you guys will feel said in guilty and then you'll

to this point project lemonade operates the reprogram project lemonade provides foster youth with a free shopping event so they too can begin their school year with new clothing shoes and confidence

you want to be stylish as a foster youth, you don't you don't get those opportunities very often that project lemonade was more than just clothes for him. the founders behind it like rhonda meadows provided jobs resume building and even a place to stay she was there for him when times got tough he was able to. jump over all the hurdles that were put in front of him. his full of perseverance and just a strong leader it wasn't just me. i it took. village of people to rally around me and all different aspects of my life to help me get to where i'm at so you know it's i don't think it's ever
