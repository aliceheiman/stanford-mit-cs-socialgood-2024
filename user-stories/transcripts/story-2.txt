0:00
[Music]
0:07
me and pastor jan and we we were just in
0:09
the beginning of kovid and so everything
0:11
was shut down we had decided that we
0:13
were going to have most of our services
0:15
outside and so we're going out in nature
0:17
and and filming all of our services and
0:20
so mine was filmed at a
0:22
river in the mountain
0:28
and so i was sitting next to this like
0:31
rocks it was very pretty and i had shots
0:33
on so
0:35
i had this short sun i just got my color
0:37
for the my very first color and i had my
0:39
my shirt my black shirt on and a collar
0:41
and it was so uncomfortable i was like
0:43
oh my god why am i wearing this thing
0:45
i mean in my brain i'm just like i
0:47
shouldn't fall in this water because i
0:50
cannot swim for the life of me and i
0:52
probably will drown it wasn't even that
0:54
much water but i was thinking this
0:56
and i stopped preaching and i'm like i
0:58
don't know if i'm going to be able to do
0:59
this
1:00
it's a bitter like of a sentence and he
1:02
says no you know just breathe and just
1:04
do your thing i'm like do you mind if i
1:06
just like free flow this sermon i
1:09
basically preached without really
1:12
following my script
1:14
but at that moment i felt like it needed
1:16
to come from my heart that that sermon
1:18
and it was a lot about fears and how few
1:21
sometimes paralyze us and stop us from
1:23
just crossing something as simple as a
1:26
river to just go over to the other side
1:34
[Music]
Story
1:44
2000 is when we first became official
1:48
refugees
1:49
i lived for my country democratic
1:51
republic of congo and it was a lot of
1:55
political issues my uncle who
1:58
my late uncle
2:00
who was very involved in a lot of human
2:02
rights stuff um
2:04
kind of just got in trouble with these
2:06
politicians
2:08
so our entire family had to like move to
2:11
uganda all
2:12
me and my brothers and him and his
2:15
entire family
2:18
as a kid it was just like
2:20
we're going to the trip
2:24
it didn't feel
2:26
anything other than we're going on a
2:27
trip it's going to be a fun trip and you
2:29
know that lasted 15 years
2:32
[Music]
2:36
and then you don't know the language and
2:38
you want to play with kids you know and
2:39
you want to go out and play with kids
2:40
and none of the kids
2:42
know what you're talking about or just
2:44
like none of the kids want to play with
2:46
you and
2:47
it was those were the most difficult
2:50
moments of
2:51
that part of growing up there's four of
2:53
us children my mom so there's a five of
2:56
us living in a one living room bedroom
3:00
it was good
3:01
again i think a lot of like
3:05
childhood
3:06
things for me were good because
3:08
i had everybody i had my cousins in the
3:11
same space i had my mom in the same
3:12
space i had my uncle right over there my
3:15
uncle was very we loved our uncle one of
3:18
my favorite memories with my uncle he
3:20
would like in the evening he would he
3:21
would sit us outside
3:23
there's a candle and he has me on his
3:25
lap and my other cards in maurizia and
3:28
then all the boys were like sitting
3:30
down and though he starts making us like
3:33
show me your talent what talent do you
3:35
have and so like my brother he was like
3:38
he he could move his one like chest and
3:40
just just
3:40
[Music]
3:43
and so like everybody was showing like
3:44
their different talents and and i didn't
3:47
have any so i'm like i don't think i
3:49
have any talent
3:51
and he says sure you do there's a movie
3:53
that mr beat had
3:55
he could move his ears right and so i'd
3:58
figured out that i could do that i tried
4:00
to i moved my ear my my one ear shaking
4:02
and my other ears shaking and it's he's
4:04
just like
4:06
he's like that is the most amazing thing
4:08
i've seen and i felt like so validated i
4:11
was super happy um he was such he was
4:14
such a great uncle i i loved i loved
4:17
having him it was
4:20
it was a
4:21
sad day when we
4:22
um
4:24
when we lost him i remember
4:28
i was home
4:29
and
4:31
her aunt comes like running over and
4:33
she's like crying
4:39
maurici is crying
4:41
my aunt is crying and i'm not i'm just
4:43
like what is happening what is going on
4:45
and i have
4:46
i i was eight i think i don't know why i
4:48
didn't
4:49
connect that he was
4:54
dying maybe a year later is when it hit
4:57
me that he was
4:58
he was gone for good
5:01
and that he wasn't ever gonna come back
5:04
um
5:06
yeah
5:15
i feel like i have a lot of rich
5:17
memories with him
5:19
life is very precious and
5:23
[Music]
5:27
to live
5:29
i think to live in a life that
5:32
you don't recognize that is missing out
5:35
on
5:36
on a lot of things
5:40
i think the biggest insecurity in any
5:42
for any refugees to be in a country that
5:44
you know
5:47
you always know you're an outsider
5:52
at some point
5:54
someone is gonna say you don't belong
5:57
you need to leave
6:06
during those years like we would
6:08
interview for like different countries
6:10
and sometimes those countries would
6:12
reject your case and they would say they
6:14
don't have it they don't have space so
6:15
they just don't feel like your skate
6:16
your case is priority like sometimes i
6:19
would wake up at like four in the
6:20
morning to go to the offices and just
6:22
like wait
6:23
wait to hear back wait to just receive
6:26
say we had like given up we're like okay
6:28
this is never gonna happen and so we're
6:30
kind of starting to like figure out
6:32
different ways
6:33
to just live life in uganda and
6:36
my mom gets this call
6:38
from from one of her friends your name
6:40
was posted on the people who
6:43
usa is going to interview
6:46
we're like what
Interview
6:49
uh interviews happen and then everything
6:51
starts happening and i'm like oh my god
6:52
it's actually happening our mom and our
6:54
little brother come
6:56
and me and terry and yanique
6:59
stay behind
7:00
uh they came in october october 5th uh
7:04
in 2016 and they were here for three
7:06
months
7:07
um they moved out after
7:10
vela's oldest child terry finally
7:12
arrived from uganda so it took three
7:15
months for him to get here they were
7:17
supposed to when we got the call from
7:18
lutheran community services they were
7:20
supposed to be here for about a week
7:23
and then all the other children were
7:24
gonna supposedly come within a week of
7:27
when
7:28
they arrived but the problem is trump
7:31
became president during that time
7:34
and trump
7:36
plans on closing the borders
7:39
me and yanik are still in uganda
7:41
[Music]
7:43
we know that if the voters are closed
7:46
then we're going to be stuck there for a
7:48
much much longer time
7:50
so it was about two weeks and we got a
7:51
call from lutheran community services
7:53
and they said
7:55
no no we're still trying to figure out
7:56
why the delay but
7:58
could they stay longer you know we could
8:00
find another place and
8:02
by then i'd we'd fallen in love with
8:04
them so i said no they should stay here
8:07
it was like having family here so mom
8:09
out here was working was already in
8:12
connection with kathleen and kathleen
8:15
and joe helped connect them i went down
8:17
to representative derrick gilmer
8:20
and
8:21
wow within days
8:23
they were here
8:24
we were among like the last few people
8:28
to cross and come
8:30
he was the most relieved like my i
8:33
remember my heart just like feeling so
8:35
light once we came
8:40
bella was almost like having my sister
8:43
we just chatted all of it all the time
8:45
it was
8:47
she was just a delight
8:48
yeah i think they're like best friends
8:52
especially when they're both looking in
8:53
crisis or like going through something
8:55
or like odin i found this recipe that i
8:59
think is really good it's just like
9:01
sharing that
9:10
when people arrive in this country
9:13
the lutheran community services tries to
9:15
find apartments but they're not always
9:17
the apartment's always ready at the time
9:19
they get here because it's going to last
9:21
a minute
9:23
so
9:25
they said
9:26
yeah we could have somebody temporarily
9:31
see these are the kind of stories that
9:33
makes sour
9:35
work so meaningful
9:37
our partner lirs
9:40
incredible
9:43
it's very strong
9:44
many people that i have worked over the
9:47
years who have been
9:49
so wonderful so committed and dedicated
9:52
to this work
9:55
they felt like my sons my sister
9:58
it's time to get started in a new life
10:01
we learn from them they learn from us i
10:04
guess
10:05
we just had a great time
10:08
she'd tell me she was thinking about
10:10
getting a masters of counseling at the
10:13
university because as an employee she
10:15
could go to the counseling program for
10:17
free
10:18
so i was encouraging her to do that but
10:20
meanwhile pastor jan
10:22
seemed to know something i didn't know
10:24
that he would be having conversations
10:26
about her called the ministry
10:30
filled with gratitude for just the
10:32
opportunity to be with her on this
10:34
journey because of what i experienced
10:36
personally from her
10:39
her natural
10:41
communication gifts and her ability to
10:43
be open and
10:45
so interested in people and welcoming of
10:48
people
10:49
she is really really gifted in what i
10:52
would call the whole field of like
10:54
pastoral care and counseling
10:57
she has a real wisdom
10:59
for her age and an ability to both
11:01
listen to people and reflect back to
11:04
people in lots of ways i'm experiencing
11:06
that in our conversations and i i see
11:08
that within her too
11:10
i was going on pastor care visits and so
11:14
i went over to hermann's place
11:16
and he was just the most warm person
11:19
that i've ever met he was just like
11:21
super welcoming
11:23
from the very beginning and there's
11:25
something about your presence your
11:28
manner or something that just
11:31
kind of ushered me into
11:33
the wider world like it was uh
11:36
more a part of the
11:39
big the
11:40
the universal body of christ you know it
11:43
was kind of empowering for me
11:48
just imagine how
11:50
it feels
11:52
to see
11:54
emily standing now in our church
11:58
with a collar and a cassock on
12:00
that's pretty neat
12:02
that's pretty neat
12:05
i thank god for that
12:08
she was preaching on jacob in the old
12:11
testament so jacob had been on the run
12:13
and
12:14
crossing this river and they were
12:16
filming it by a river i remember and
12:18
emily was preaching
12:21
that when she was done with the sermon
12:22
joe and i looked at each other and just
12:24
said
12:25
wow
12:27
i mean she was all ready she hadn't even
12:29
had any classes at school yet
12:32
even with those fears and with all of
12:34
our past kind of like jacob's weirdness
12:37
and all of the craziness of our lives
12:39
and the things that we think define who
12:41
we are
12:42
[Music]
12:43
stop us from seeing who god calls us you
12:46
know that god calls us beloved that
12:48
we're loved and held and just you know
12:52
embraced by god even even though we were
12:55
like messed up in so many ways and just
12:57
taking that one step just crossing over
12:59
that river and getting over that fear
13:01
saying i'm gonna go into this and see
13:03
what god is calling me into
13:22
when people say seattle is the city of
13:24
rain they're really not joking
13:27
like there are days
13:29
it rains from morning to evening and you
13:32
wake up the next day and it's still
13:33
raining like it's just non-stop constant
13:36
rain
13:37
in the first two years
13:39
that was really really hard
13:44
i
13:45
love
13:46
washington it's calm
13:48
i'm not a person that loves the city a
13:51
lot
13:53
feels comfortable for me to be myself to
13:56
go out
14:00
i mean obviously anybody that comes
14:03
as a refugee has
14:04
left everything behind
14:06
to
14:08
witness somebody or to just know
14:10
somebody who has experienced that kind
14:13
of pain and suffering yet is so
14:18
loving
14:20
but willing to speak speak that and
14:23
share that i just think that's important
14:27
i've always wanted to have home
14:31
i haven't fully found a place
14:34
that i personally call home outside of
14:36
my mom
14:38
i feel like i'm slowly getting there i
14:40
have a lot of you know like kathleen and
14:43
joe have become part of our family you
14:45
know hope i can create a home here like
14:48
that
14:50
[Music]
15:04
[Applause]
15:19
you
