I myself want to become a foster parent when I'm older I know it's needed and I'm sure anyone would appreciate it I was 11 when I moved here my dad he got in trouble without any documents here in the United States you can get in real trouble with anything small I was 13 by then when we were living in Minnesota and he was being transferred back to Guatemala they put me in the facility in Arizona I just had this really big dream of like continuing with my education and learning more things I had this big picture like of me going into college and I just I couldn't throw that away that easily I had two younger siblings but now I have three Juanita is a is a blessing kind of a dream come true when it comes to what we thought about foster care she was shy and quiet at 13 arriving not knowing exactly what to make of our family or what to make of this experience but through the last 5 years we've all grown together when we welcomed D to our family with five other people in this house living but we also like welcomed her into our extended families all these little people along the way that had an impact in her trajectory and her journey guess there was some uniqueness to her situation but this is what kids are going through at these different phases in their growth 14 it was you know trying to find out what activities she enjoyed and some things she tried and was like well um I tried it I thought I wanted to do it turns out I don't really like that this blasing of getting to know a young person very well in a structured way where there's some support but it's made our lives better it's made us just better people I would try cross country you know it was fun in my first meet I was like oh my gosh am I beating everybody else she's really interested in the body and helping people health and wellness and recover from injuries Sports I was in the National Honor Society for Spanish I got two scholarships we viewed these last few years as a chance to build family together to know that this is a long-term foster care program that we don't see really ending the program has definitely helped a lot by supporting me with through the years and it was because of a Centuria we try to be really thoughtful and make informed decisions and set families up for Success licensing a foster family part of the process is a home study or a caregiver assessment there was there was kids that were in need and once it was approved it was pretty fast instantly we definitely felt a connection my case worker has played a big big big role in my past 3 years checking up on me and setting goals as santria has been able to provide that structure to do this in an organized way hanita was always very interested in education and completing high school and going to college and both Serenity and Vinnie are Educators in her home country in Guatemala Juanita is a big sister so it was very natural for her to step in and have younger siblings she's a very typical older sibling the activities that they can do together they want to be around her and she usually wants to do it alongside them as well happiest moment there's a lot the family and I travel we just came back from Columbus Ohio because Isaiah my foster brother and little sister they both play Pok√©mon and so they had a tournament and so we were like oh let's just go then there's an image in my head where she has you know like 10 medals on in her track uniform maybe a year or two before that that I was like oh this is like something she's really passionate about my proudest moment for Wanita tells the story of living in our house we received the time when she was going to get her announcement from Smith college and everything was all set up we had 15 minutes before we had to head out the door and want need to turns to me it's like I I forgot my password 2 hours later after they figure out all of the the issues that we get a phone call and they were so enthusiastic and excited just want's presence in front of people has been able to open their eyes to change them in certain ways to question some of their held views they've experienced her and they love her and they love her for Vining andc serinity becoming my foster parents has definitely helped me out a lot helped me grow without them I don't think I would be as involved as I am including with sports I know they're not my biological parents but it feels like
