I myself want to become a foster parent
0:05
when I'm older I know it's
0:08
needed and I'm sure anyone would
0:11
appreciate
0:14
[Music]
0:15
it I was 11 when I moved here my dad he
0:19
got in trouble without any documents
0:22
here in the United States you can get in
0:23
real trouble with anything small I was
0:26
13 by then when we were living in
0:28
Minnesota and he was being transferred
0:31
back to Guatemala they put me in the
0:33
facility in
0:36
Arizona I just had this really big dream
0:39
of like continuing with my education and
0:41
learning more things I had this big
0:43
picture like of me going into college
0:46
and I just I couldn't throw that away
0:48
that
0:49
easily I had two younger siblings but
0:52
now I have
0:54
three Juanita is a is a blessing kind of
0:58
a dream come true when it comes to what
1:00
we thought about foster care she was shy
1:04
and quiet at 13 arriving not knowing
1:07
exactly what to make of our family or
1:09
what to make of this experience but
1:11
through the last 5 years we've all grown
1:13
together when we welcomed D to our
1:16
family with five other people in this
1:19
house living but we also like welcomed
1:22
her into our extended families all these
1:26
little people along the way that had an
1:29
impact in her trajectory and her journey
1:31
guess there was some uniqueness to her
1:33
situation but this is what kids are
1:35
going through at these different phases
1:37
in their growth 14 it was you know
1:39
trying to find out what activities she
1:41
enjoyed and some things she tried and
1:43
was like well um I tried it I thought I
1:45
wanted to do it turns out I don't really
1:47
like that this blasing of getting to
1:51
know a young person very well in a
1:54
structured way where there's some
1:56
support but it's made our lives better
1:59
it's made us just better
2:02
people I would try cross country you
2:07
know it was
2:09
fun in my first meet I was like oh my
2:12
gosh am I beating everybody
2:16
else she's really interested in the body
2:19
and helping people health and wellness
2:22
and recover from injuries Sports I was
2:26
in the National Honor Society for
2:29
Spanish I got two
2:34
scholarships we viewed these last few
2:37
years as a chance to build family
2:41
together to know that this is a
2:44
long-term foster care program that we
2:47
don't see really
2:49
[Music]
2:58
ending
3:00
the program has definitely helped a lot
3:03
by supporting me with through the years
3:05
and it was because of a Centuria we try
3:09
to be really thoughtful and make
3:11
informed decisions and set families up
3:13
for Success licensing a foster family
3:15
part of the process is a home study or a
3:18
caregiver
3:20
assessment there was there was kids that
3:22
were in need and once it was approved it
3:26
was pretty fast instantly we definitely
3:29
felt a connection my case worker has
3:32
played a big big big role in my past 3
3:35
years checking up on me and setting
3:38
goals as santria has been able to
3:40
provide that structure to do this in an
3:42
organized
3:44
way hanita was always very interested in
3:47
education and completing high school and
3:49
going to college and both Serenity and
3:51
Vinnie are
3:52
Educators in her home country in
3:55
Guatemala Juanita is a big sister so it
3:58
was very natural for her to step in and
4:00
have younger
4:01
siblings she's a very typical older
4:07
sibling the activities that they can do
4:09
together they want to be around her and
4:12
she usually wants to do it alongside
4:14
them as
4:16
well happiest moment there's a lot the
4:20
family and I travel we just came back
4:22
from Columbus Ohio because Isaiah my
4:25
foster brother and little sister they
4:27
both play Pok√©mon and so they had a
4:30
tournament and so we were like oh let's
4:31
just go
4:35
then there's an image in my head where
4:37
she has you know like 10 medals on in
4:41
her track uniform maybe a year or two
4:43
before that that I was like oh this is
4:46
like something she's really passionate
4:49
about my proudest moment for Wanita
4:53

4:55
we received the time when she was going
4:58

5:04
minutes before we had to head out the
5:05
door and want need to turns to me it's
5:08
like I I forgot my
5:13
password 2 hours later after they figure
5:16
out all of the the issues that we get a
5:18
phone call and they were so enthusiastic
5:22
and
5:28
excited
5:30
just want's presence in front of people
5:33
has been able to open their eyes to
5:36
change them in certain ways to question
5:39
some of their held views they've
5:41
experienced her and they love her and
5:44
they love
5:44
her for Vining andc serinity becoming my
5:47
foster parents has definitely helped me
5:50
out a lot helped me
5:53

5:55
be as involved as I am including with
5:58
sports I know they're not my biological
6:01
parents but it feels like
