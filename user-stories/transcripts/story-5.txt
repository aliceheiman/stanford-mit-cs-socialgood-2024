Trust was a really big issue over of
0:07
course of eleven years I've probably
0:10
moved around in between homes and
0:13
different families 15 times we're just
0:18
having this normal check-in and at the
0:19
very end of it they were like what would
0:21
you think about and what would you want
0:24
if we were able to tell you that you
0:26
would be able to find a home I really
0:29
had negative thoughts on it I'm not
0:32
gonna ever find a forever home I'm just
0:34
gonna end up back in the foster home
0:36
getting that news really put me into
0:38
like oh my gosh oh my gosh this is
0:40
finally happening it's something that
0:43
I've always wanted but I mean at times
0:46
it was like this is not gonna happen
0:47
there's no point even looking and trying
0:50
any further he wasn't sure if he wanted
0:54
to be adopted because he didn't know who
0:56
the family would be that would adopt him
0:58
and that we really resonated with me
1:00
because I just thought like that makes
1:03
so much sense you know but then once we
1:06
all met each other and got to know each
1:07
other I mean we quickly as a family
1:10
started talking about adoption and
1:12
that's our futures headed my name is
1:16
Jenny and I'm Alex's mom absurd that
1:19
Alex's father
1:21
ALX express he wanted to be with the
1:23
family that was gonna love him for who
1:24
he was and would have adventures and do
1:27
things and that's kind of what we're all
1:29
about
1:30
when we saw Alex and his video and read
1:34
about him it was just like wow it kids
1:38
made for us
1:41
first time I ever met them I was at my
1:44
old foster home through boys and girls
1:46
aid and we had planned for this and I
1:49
was super excited I was like this is
1:51
gonna be awesome it's just the strangest
1:53
thing to like knock on the door and know
1:55
that you're gonna you know meet your kid
2:01
when I actually moved in it was awesome
2:07
remember we were coming down the
2:08
driveway and we were talking about all
2:10
the animals and the house and all these
2:13
different things Alex jumps in with both
2:17
feet
2:17
to most circumstances and he did that
2:20
with the animals
2:23
means they're pretty much familiar with
2:25
everything here from cooking to starting
2:28
trucks and driving trucks that you just
2:30
learned a lot they have these two people
2:34
in my life that I can trust is just a
2:35
really big thing because I can actually
2:37
know that it's going to go somewhere we
2:42
hope for Alex everything that you know
2:44
any any parent would hope for their kids
2:47
hopefully that our love and the
2:50
stability and always having a place to
2:53
come home to will give him that
2:54
foundation to do all the great things
2:58
that he you know that his aren't heart
3:00
desires so I've always wanted to go to
3:03
college and get a good job being here I
3:05
have a ten times better chance at doing
3:08
any of those know that there's a ton of
3:13
kids out there who are maybe they're
3:18
just looking for someone to love them
3:27
from where our family is it's just it's
3:31
just been the best thing
3:34
it feels good it feels good to have a
3:37
place that you know if somebody's gonna
3:39
care for you and want you I think we
3:43
bring it from endless amount to Alex and
3:44
they think he brings even more to us I
3:46
mean we've got a big beautiful life and
3:48
to to be able to bring Alex into our
3:51
home and into our hearts and into our
3:53
lives that's been amazing it's a
3:55
blessing
4:04
